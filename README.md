# Bitcoin-Correlation-Interactive-Report
An interactive report made in Power-BI using python scripts showcasing bitcoins highest correlation with other assets/metrics with respect to time. If two variables are highly positively correlated (value close to 1) with respect to time, they will rise and fall at almost the same time:

The interactive report can be used to compare what correlations persisted each year in the past. The time can also be sliced for each year to narrow down to areas of high volumes of trade to see which correlations dominated during that time. It can also be used, by for example a professional trader, to open long or short positions based on latest data coming from the API and see which metric is the highest correlated now. Finally, it can also be used to see the average, maximum and minimum bitcoin daily closing price over a time frame.
